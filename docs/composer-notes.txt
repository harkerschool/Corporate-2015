== Can't change format of text in Header and Footer in element's design settings.
== Error is thrown when loading element settings (sometimes).
== Can't find "Display more events" link in Calendar element.
== How do you create an athletics team page?
== Adding and moving elements in containers is difficult. 
Instead of 'Add Above' and 'Add Below', simplify and just add the element below. Then, if the admin user wants to add an element above another, they'd just click the 'Add Element' button that's above the element.
== Can we use this div structure for ALL elements:
<div class="element">
    <header class="row">
        <div class="col">
        </div>
    </header>
    <div class="content row">
        <div class="col">
            <div class="element">
                <!-- same element structure -->
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <footer class="row">
        <div class="col">
        </div>
    </footer>
</div>
** Add .col div for columns elements.
** Container elements would go inside content.
